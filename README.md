# Slice-to-Volume-registration-on-Brain-MRI
## Abstract
Image registration is the process of aligning images collected from two or more images into the same coordinate system. This problem has become one of the most important areas in computer vision and medical imaging . In the last decade, slice-to-volume registration, a special case of the image registration problem, has received a lot of attention in medical image studies. Slice-to-Volume registration is a process where we seek to determine the slice, which corresponds to a plane, from a given 3D volume that aligns with the input 2D slice. This method can aid image-guided surgery and benefit motion correction and volume reconstruction. Slice-to-Volume registration is also often used to register intra-operative 2D MRI or CT images to pre-operative 3D volumes to provide timely guidance for operation
